I want to create an app named 'Staff Igreja Ação do Espírito' for my church (can be a native app or PWA) to manage volunteer/staff registration. The app should have a yellowish-green color theme (hex code: #9ACD32 or similar) and include:  1. Registration Form Required fields (in Portuguese):  Nome completo (Full name)  Data de nascimento (Date of birth)  WhatsApp/E-mail  Função na igreja (Church role – dropdown with options like: Louvor, Diaconia, Recepção, Infantil, Mídia, etc.)  Dias/turnos disponíveis (Available days/shifts – checkboxes: Domingo manhã/tarde, Semana à noite, etc.)  Optional fields:  Habilidades específicas (Specific skills, e.g., playing instruments, graphic design)  Observações (Notes)  2. Backend/Management Store data in a database (Firebase or SQLite).  Allow leaders to filter volunteers by role, availability, or registration date.  Export data to Excel/PDF.  3. Design & Branding Color scheme: Primarily yellowish-green (#9ACD32) with complementary colors.  Logo/Header: Include the app name 'Staff Igreja Ação do Espírito' prominently.  Clean, intuitive interface with a church-appropriate aesthetic.  4. Technology For native apps: Use Flutter (recommended) or React Native.  For PWAs: Next.js + Firebase/Supabase.  Ensure offline-first functionality.  5. Extras Secure leader login (email/Google).  Notifications for new registrations or shift reminders.  Deliverables:  UI mockup (with the color scheme and branding).  Basic frontend + backend code.  Steps to deploy.  Note: Prioritize simplicity and GDPR compliance."
